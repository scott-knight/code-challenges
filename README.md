# code-challenges

This repo contains my coding solutions to challenges given to me in job interviews. 

After completing a code challenge, I like do a quick review and post the wording of the challenge and my code soltution. 

Each challenge contains a description, the code, and test code. The only exception is [the Ruby command-line script which does group matching on contacts in a CSV](https://github.com/scott-knight/code-challenges/tree/master/group-matching-contacts). The code is in the script and the testing comes from manually running the code as described in the [README](https://github.com/scott-knight/code-challenges/blob/master/group-matching-contacts/README.md). 

Feel free to use the code for whatever you need, however, please provide a refence to my code if you do.
